# unified-mentor-second-project-mobile-phone-pricing

## Description

The Mobile Phone Pricing project is a data-driven application designed to analyze and visualize pricing trends in the mobile phone market. Using real-world mobile phone data, the project helps users understand how prices vary based on features such as brand, storage capacity, RAM, and operating system. The project includes interactive visualizations to make insights intuitive and easy to interpret.

## Project Overview

This project explores mobile phone pricing data and presents it using various data visualization techniques. It is aimed at helping buyers, sellers, and analysts make informed decisions by understanding price trends, market segmentation, and popular features influencing cost. Python is used for data analysis and visualization.

## Concepts Included

The coding in this project covers several key concepts in data analysis and visualization:

1. **Data Handling with Pandas**

   * The dataset is loaded and processed using the Pandas library.
   * Features like brand, RAM, storage, and price are cleaned and prepared for analysis.

2. **Bar Graphs**

   * Bar graphs compare categorical data, such as average phone price by brand or storage capacity.
   * Helps identify which brands or configurations are more expensive or affordable.

3. **Histograms**

   * Histograms show the distribution of mobile phone prices, revealing how prices are spread across different ranges.
   * Useful for spotting clusters, trends, and outliers in pricing.

4. **Pie Charts**

   * Pie charts visualize the proportion of phones by categories like brand, operating system, or battery capacity.
   * Provides a quick summary of the dataset composition.

5. **Regression Analysis (Optional)**

   * Regression can be applied to predict mobile phone prices based on features like RAM, storage, or brand.
   * Helps in estimating market value and understanding factors influencing pricing.

## How to Use

1. Load the dataset using Python and Pandas.
2. Run the visualization scripts to generate bar graphs, histograms, and pie charts.
3. Analyze the charts to gain insights into mobile phone pricing patterns.

## Tools & Libraries

* **Python** – Main programming language.
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – For creating bar graphs, histograms, and pie charts.
* **Scikit-learn (Optional)** – For regression analysis and price prediction.
